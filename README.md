# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

=============================

1. Used React hooks to create Login and To-do App
2. Used Material UI to add inut fields with icons and styles to match the mock
3. Tried both axios and fetch but running into issues while hitting rapptr endpoint
4. So byapssed it to test the flow
5. Once we login successfully, It should navigate to To Do app
6. You can see the default two items on your first visit
7. You can add new todo's, or edit existing ones
8. These get saved so that once we log back in, we see the same items.
9. We can delete individual items and see the result persisted again.
10. Once you hit logout it should return to login page.

Used hooks, scss, materialUI

It took almost 8 - 9  hours almost as i was searching for similar looking text components to match the login form.
It took tine to hit the API, as i tried alsmot three to four ways but always ran into 400 Bad request.

2 hrs -basic components and functionality
2 hrs styling
2 hrs API debugging but in vain
2 hrs testing and refactoring the app.

As i had other interviews as weel, I could not dedicate much time as I intended.
But I think i tried my level best to cover all cases except the API issue..
